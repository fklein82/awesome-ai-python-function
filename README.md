# Python Function with Image Detection üêçü¶æ

This repository hosts a Python Function capable of being deployed as a TAP workload, enhanced to detect and analyze contents within images.

The function leverages VMware's open-source [Function Buildpacks for Knative](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/function-buildpacks-for-knative), providing a seamless integration for image processing capabilities.

## Getting Started

To customize your function for image content detection, refer to the following file structure:

python-function
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ func.py // MODIFY THIS FILE FOR IMAGE DETECTION


In the `func.py` file, a default function is provided. Modify this function to incorporate your image detection logic. For example:

```python
def main(data: Any, attributes: dict):
    # Implement your image detection logic here
    detected_content = detect_image_contents(data)
    return attributes, f"Detected Content: {detected_content}"
```
Replace the example implementation with your specific image detection code. For additional examples of deployable code as a Function (FaaS) with image processing features, visit the samples folder.

## Add the Accelerator on VMware Tanzu Application Platform

```bash
tanzu acc create awesome-python-ai-image-function --git-repo https://github.com/fklein82/awesome-ai-python-function.git --git-branch main --interval 5s\n
```

### Deploying on VMware Tanzu Application Platform
To deploy this application on VMware Tanzu Application Platform, follow these steps:

Ensure you have the Tanzu CLI installed and configured with access to your Tanzu Application Platform instance.

Navigate to your project directory:
```bash
cd [your-repo-directory]
```
Use the Tanzu CLI to deploy your application:
```bash
tanzu apps workload create -f config/workload.yaml
```
Monitor the deployment status:
```bash
tanzu apps workload tail python-ai-image-function --timestamp --since 1h
```
Once deployed, access your application via the URL provided by Tanzu Application Platform. You can find the url with the following command:
```bash
tanzu apps workload get python-ai-image-function
```

## Overview of the Python Function with Image Detection
### Purpose:
This Python function is designed to be deployed as a TAP (Tanzu Application Platform) workload. Its primary role is to detect and analyze content within images, leveraging the capabilities of VMware's Function Buildpacks for Knative. This makes it a crucial component for applications requiring image processing and analysis.

### File Structure:
func.py: The central file where the image detection logic is implemented.

### Function Details:
- Function Name: main
- Parameters:
    - data: The input data to the function, expected to be an image or image data.
    - attributes: A dictionary that can hold additional metadata or attributes related to the image.
- Return Values: The function returns a tuple containing:
    - The attributes dictionary, potentially modified or enriched based on the image analysis.
    - A string message or data structure that describes the detected content in the image.

### Implementation:
- The main function initially contains a placeholder implementation.

- Users are expected to replace the placeholder with actual image detection logic. This could involve integrating image processing libraries or algorithms to analyze the content of data.
